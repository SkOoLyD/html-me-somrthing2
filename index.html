                <p>My path to coding wasn't a really unexpected one.
                    I grew up around computers most of my life, I remember the first computer
                    my dad let me play on was an old apple computer,
                    with the mouse that had one big button! I remember
                    the floppy disc the square black plastic ones and the smaller
                    ones you had to have for class the 3.5's !!(a:drive).So
                    in a way I was kinda already exposed acdt an early age.</p>

            <h2>The Middle</h2>
            <article>
                <p>Altough I found a joy in playing computer games,
                    I also began to develop a love for sports and music. So playing computers games
                    started to fade and getting dirty and making noise became my
                    new hobby. Nevertheless computers still made a way in my life, this
                    time it was through school. In middle school computer classes were offered
                    and this is when I began to learn about Microsoft Office and learning
                    how to make PowerPoint presentations.

            <h1>The End</h1>
            <article>
                <p>So after taking the fun road of life and growing pains,I
                    managed to go to college and meet wonderful people, and
                    along the way I managed to meet my wonderful wife. Where we
                    began to have a family with our son. And after all the things
                    I have been through it led me back to this point. Being able to use
                    my passion for technology, problem solving, and computers to provide
                    a good life for my family. With hard work and perservance I believe
                    that I will be able to complete my journey as a Coder!!
